# **Soft Skills in IT**

## **Questions**

- You have our offer and several others, how will you choose? (Tip: Consider career opportunities, a healthy team environment, competitive salary is also important, remote work, etc.)
- Why are you leaving your previous job? (Tip: It's important not to criticize your past employer or label all colleagues as toxic, avoid going into strong negatives.)
- Why should we choose you?
- What are your salary expectations? (Tip: State them and justify: I expect these figures because I have a), b), c), d).)
- Tell us about yourself. (Tip: A clear story in 3-4 minutes about how you brought value to the projects, how you evolved, no longer than 3-4 minutes, because the listener may lose focus.)
- What motivates you in your work? Why did you choose this specific technology/direction?
- How do you stay motivated?
- How do you stay up-to-date with new technologies?
- What are your weaknesses? (Tip: Here the key is not to overdo it, name something not so important. For instance, I used to be afraid of public speaking and dealing with customers, but now I'm not afraid and do it well.)
- How do you resolve a conflict with a colleague? How do you deal with toxic or unconventional colleagues?
- Can you give an example of when you worked productively with a team?
- Can you give an example of when you took initiative?
- Tell us about a situation where you did your best on a project?
- Can you give an example of when you successfully negotiated with a client/manager/team lead? What should be the focus? What should be avoided?
- Tell us about a situation where you failed (The key here is to switch from negative to positive, yes there was such a bad situation, but I still managed to handle it and gain this experience.)
- Tell us about a situation where after a failure, you had to return to work, in other words: how do you recover/find strength to get back on track?
- How do you deal with complex, big and unclear tasks?
- What are your questions for us? (Tip: Prepare 2-4 questions to a) indeed, resolve these issues b) show your interest in the position/company.)
- Your colleague is sabotaging you in code review: ignoring comments, getting into a verbal altercation, delaying deadlines. What are your actions? (Tip: Talk to the colleague, if you can't solve it, go to the team lead, team, solve it together.)
- Looking back at your career, what was important to you in a particular project/company (people, product, benefit that we brought with this product.)
- Middle vs Senior developers. Why do you think you are a Senior/Middle developer?
- Tell me how you understand Scrum and what benefits it brings.
